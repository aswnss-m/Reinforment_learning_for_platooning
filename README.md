![Project Image](project_image.jpg) <!-- Replace with an image that represents your project -->

## Overview

This repository contains the codebase and documentation for the "Reinforcement Learning Model for Platooning in Autonomous Driving" project. The project aims to develop an intelligent system using reinforcement learning to enable autonomous vehicles to platoon effectively, enhancing traffic flow, fuel efficiency, and road safety.

## Project Objectives

- Design a reinforcement learning model that optimizes platooning decisions such as vehicle spacing, speed adjustments, and lane changes.
- Create a simulation environment that accurately represents real-world driving scenarios to train and evaluate the model.
- Integrate the reinforcement learning model with the broader context of autonomous driving decision-making.
- Evaluate the model's performance based on metrics like traffic efficiency, fuel consumption, and safety.
